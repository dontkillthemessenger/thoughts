# Thoughts

This is a Git repository to develop a (hopefully consistent) set of thoughts,
viewpoints and opinions on a broad set of topics, mostly focused on politics
and society, but some philosophical and scientific topics might be touched as
well.

If you have different insights or opinions, you can express these by forking
the repository.
