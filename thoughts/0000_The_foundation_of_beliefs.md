# The foundation of beliefs

The beliefs held by one person often contradict those held by another person.
Sometimes, a single person holds beliefs that contradict each other. How can
we know what we should believe?

## Truth

First of all, let's assume there *is* such a thing as "truth": there is an
objective reality in which all of us live. Beliefs are true if they correspond
to the state of reality, and false otherwise.

If there were no objective reality, there would be no difference between true
and false beliefs. The assumption "there is no objective reality" seems
self-defeating, though: in that case, the statement
"there is an objective reality" would be just as "true" as
"there is *no* objective reality". So, even if there is no objective reality,
there seems to be no harm in believing there is one.

Secondly, let's assume that reality is logically consistent. If it were not, we
would have no method of reasoning about reality; since we wish to reason, this
assumption is necessary. Note that a logically inconsistent reality (e.g. where
"A" is true and "*not* A" is also true) is very similar to the situation where
there is no objective reality, which we rejected earlier. Also note that I
assumed here that there is no method of reasoning about logically inconsistent
systems, or that, if there is one, it can be translated into a method based
on logic. In the second case, it would be possible to formulate a logically
consistent description of reality; this is close enough to having a logically
consistent reality that the difference seems unimportant.

Under these assumptions, we already know that if a certain set of beliefs is
internally inconsistent, at least a part of it has to be false.

### What can we know?

We are very limited in our methods for discovering reality. When other people
tell us things, or when we read things written by other people, those people
could be lying to us, or they could in honesty be transferring their own false
beliefs. We could observe reality with our own eyes (or with other senses),
but our senses can easily be fooled (either deliberately or accidentally). In an
extreme case, we could be completely immersed in a simulated reality, as in the
movie "the Matrix", and not be aware that the reality we observe is not the
"true" reality. Even our memories can not necessarily be trusted.

One thing we can hold true is our observations themselves. So, if you observe
that the sun is shining, you can hold true "I observe that the sun is shining".
Note that this is different from "the sun is shining", which is not necessarily
true: it is possible that the observation is somehow an illusion. Observations
are subjective: "I observe that the sun is shining" contains an "I". The belief
that the sun is *actually* shining is a possible explanation for the
observation, especially when you observe other people confirming that the sun
is shining, but there are other possible explanations. On top of that, reality
could be more complicated: sometimes, the sun is shining and sometimes it is
not, and typically the sun is shining in some places, but not in other places.

Another thing we can hold true is definitions. Mathematical truths are examples:
if we define a circle as all points in a plane that are of distance R from a
center point C, then, by definition it is true for all points on a circle that
their distance from C is R. These truths are essentially tautologies, and don't
provide new information about reality. They are truths about imaginary objects,
constructed entirely inside our own minds; essentially, they are true because
we *made* them true.

Some caution is needed here: since there are essentially no limits to what kind
of imaginary concepts we can create, it is possible to define things that
contain logical contradictions; such self-contradicting constructions are
nonsense, and should not be considered to hold truth. Also, just because two
imaginary concepts are similar and/or bear the same name, does not mean that
truths about one of them are true about the other. This is especially tricky
in discussions with other people: because of the nature of language, we use
words to refer to our mental concepts, but if different people use the same
word for (slightly) different concepts, confusion can occur. This is a source
of many disagreements.

Based on the things we hold true, we can deduce other truths by logic reasoning.
At this stage, logic reasoning won't bring us very far, since our set of known
truths consists of a set of observations and a set of imaginary concepts, with
no logical connections between them. At best, we can derive all sorts of
mathematical truths; this is possible since all mathematical objects, like
points, lines and numbers, are essentially all imaginary (even though many are
made to resemble the world as we observe it). On itself, it does not provide
new information about the world outside our mind.

## Science

While we don't necessarily need to have a full set of beliefs (it is OK to
just "not know" some things), the knowledge gained with observations and
logic alone is far from sufficient as a basis for our decision-making.
Other methods are needed; one such method is the "scientific method".

### The scientific method

There are several different ideas of what the scientific method exactly
consists of, and not all scientists follow exactly the same methods. However,
the following seems to be broadly accepted:

 1. Scientific beliefs ("theories") are such that, based on those beliefs, you
    can, through logic, make predictions about certain observations.
 2. The observations predicted by science are typically of the type
    "if you do this, that will be the result". The result has to be objective:
    it has to be independent of who is doing the experiment / observation.
 3. If an observation contradicts a prediction of a theory, it falsifies the
    theory, and the theory has to be replaced / adjusted such that the new
    observation is correctly predicted. Again, this is only true if the
    observation is objective (can be replicated by other people).
 4. A scientific theory is based on previous observations. Whenever there are
    multiple theories that correctly predict / explain the previous observations,
    the simplest theory has to be selected (this rule is called "Occam's razor").

As an example, in physics, there is a law called the "conservation of momentum",
which states that, in a system that has no external forces acting on it, the sum
of the momenta (mass times velocity) of all objects in the system has to remain
the same. This satisfies the rules above:

 1. It predicts for instance that a rocket in space, ejecting exhaust gas in one
    direction, accelerates in the other direction, in exactly such amount that
    the sum of the momentum of the exhaust gas and the momentum of the rocket
    stays the same.
 2. The prediction is independent of who builds/operates/measures the rocket.
    You just have to be honest about the conditions (no external forces) and
    about the actual observations you make.
 3. No violations of conservation of momentum have ever been observed: all
    claims in that direction could either not be replicated by other people,
    or it was shown that the experiment was not correct (e.g. there were external
    forces present).
 4. There could be many theories that explain experimental results so far, but
    "the total of all momentum always stays the same" is a pretty simple theory,
    and explains a lot of experimental results.

Because of "Occam's razor", science can be seen as a form of "data compression":
science gives us the smallest /simplest set of rules that correctly predicts all
scientific observations we've made so far; this set of rules tends to be smaller
than the original set of observations. Occam observed that the simplest
explanations often turn out to be correct; in other words, scientific theories
tend to be very effective in predicting the outcomes of future observations.

### Limitations

Scientific theories are not *guaranteed* to be true. If a thousand observations
all follow a certain pattern, it makes sense to theorize that the pattern will
*always* be followed, but strictly speaking, that is not necessarily true. In
fact, in the history of science, there have been several instances where an
existing theory, successfully predicting the outcomes of many observations, was
eventually falsified by some new observations. Typically, these new observations
would lead to a new theory that explains all observations, old and new.
While the new theory can be considered "more true" than the old theory, the old
theory is usually not completely thrown away: often, it still provides a simpler
way of predicting a limited set of observations. For instance, Newton's mechanics
have been shown to be incorrect, and are now replaced by Einstein's theory of
general relativity, but for speeds that are much smaller than the speed of
light, Newton's mechanics still give accurate predictions. Only: we now know we
should stop using Newton's mechanics when speeds approach the speed of light.

Besides the fact that there is no logic necessity that the simplest explanation
is the true explanation, the scientific method is limited by the fact that it
is only based on observations. Even more: it is only based on observations that
are *objective* and *repeatable* by others. The scientific method does not work
well for one-off and completely subjective observations, and it doesn't work at
all for things that are completely un-observable. Science tends to reject
theories that contain un-observable phenomena, if they are not necessary for
explaining scientific observations, since such a theories would not be the
simplest theory possible. Sometimes, pheonomena that are not directly observable
*are* accepted as scientific, if they lead to theories that explain / predict a
wide range of scientific observations in a simple and elegant way, that would
not be possible without assuming the existence of these non-observable
phenomena.

Also, since science is only involved in explaining and predicting observations,
it can only results in factual beliefs. For instance, it can inform us about
what *is* and what *is not*, but not about what *should be* and what
*should not be*, at least, not on its own. In addition to science, a moral
framework would be needed for that.

Finally, science is limited in that it assumes the world to be regular and
predictable. In the field of quantum mechanics (which describes the behavior
of the smallest fundamental particles of matter), science has run into the
limits of this model. It turns out that, for certain situations in quantum
mechanics, the best science can do is to accurately predict the *probability* of
certain observations: it can not accurately predict the observations themselves.
It is still scientific in the sense that, if such experiments are repeated
many times to estimate the distribution of outcomes, quantum mechanics
correctly predicts the observed distribution. However, individual outcomes seem
to be out of reach of scientific predictability.

### Strengths

The strengths of science are very much related to its weaknesses. Its greatest
strength, in my view, is its objectivity: different (groups of) people, all
following the scientific method, should eventually converge to very similar
beliefs. This makes scientific beliefs suitable for being shared between
different people. I think it goes too far to demand from other people
to accept the truth of scientific beliefs: after all, they are not logically
guaranteed to be true. However, the same is also the case for more subjective,
non-scientific beliefs. If it is really necessary to reach consensus, science is
the best thing we have, when it comes to finding common ground with other
people.


## Religion

Since religions form structures of beliefs that are held by many people, I
consider them to be of importance, and they should be discussed here.
The wide variety between religions makes it hard to compare them.

A very simplified view of "belief sets" would be to see what it is optimized
for. The fact that so little can be logically deduced about the nature of
reality allows different belief sets to choose different directions; one reason
for choosing a different direction could be to go after a different goal.

In this view, the goal of the scientific belief set would be *objectivity*.
Anything that can not objectively be verified is rejected as non-scientific;
the simplest explanation for observations is selected since that is the
most objective thing to do: assuming there is an objective metric for
simplicity, there is always one most simple explanation, while there are
infinite possibilities of generating more complex explanations.

### Christianity

The way I see Christianity is that it optimizes for *hope*; in particular, the
hope that we will be able to live in a world without suffering and injustice.
Like the scientific belief set, the Christian belief set has evolved
historically; evidence of this can be found in the Bible.

 1. It was observed that our own efforts to end suffering and injustice are
    insufficient; therefore our only hope is that there is a good and just
    God who is in control of the world, and who will help us.
 2. Initially, the belief was that God would reward the good and punish the bad,
    a bit similar to the idea of *karma*. However, it was observed that this
    is not the case. Therefore, the idea developed that judgement was delayed
    until after we die, and that all injustice would be corrected in an
    afterlife (those who performed injustice will be punished; those who
    suffered will be rewarded).
 3. Finally, the realization set in that, if we look honesly to ourselves, none
    of us could survive such a judgement, since we all destroy more than we
    create in this world. Our only hope would be if God shows mercy on us.
    However, since the debts created by our injustice still need to be paid, it
    is necessary that God himself voluntarily pays off those debts.

Christianity is a bit more specific than this, for instance, it assumes
that Jesus is God in human form, who came to earth to carry our punishments;
essentially, this is based on eye witness reports. However, the above is, the
way I see it, the core of how Christianity "works".

A belief that is based on hope does not have to be very plausible. Of course,
plausible is preferred over non-plausible, but if the only belief system that
gives you hope is a relatively implausible one, it makes sense to grab onto
that one, no matter how implausible it is.

From a Christian point of view, the fact that other religions exist does not
invalidate the Christian belief, since those other religions do not follow all
of the same reasoning of Christianity, so they do not offer the same hope, and
are therefore not of equal value as Christianity. This is analogous to how,
from a scientist point of view, religious beliefs do not offer the same
objectivity, and are therefore not of equal value as science. It may very well
be that other belief systems optimize for other things, and therefore do not
consider science *or* Christianity as of equal value as their own beliefs.


## A pragmatic approach

### Agnosticism

Since, for nearly all relevant beliefs it is the case that they can not be
logically guaranteed to be true, an honest thing to do would be to admit that
we don't know, or at least we don't know for sure, and to keep all options open.
However, decisions need to be made in life, and those decisions will be based
on beliefs. Besides, our mental capacity is limited, so it is impractical to
take all infinite possibilities into account.

The situation in life is somewhat similar to that of a stockbroker. A
stockbroker does not know for sure what companies are going to rise or fall in
value, but he has to speculate on a particular outcome in order to make trading
decisions. Even though the stockbroker may mentally consider multiple
possibilities, pragmatically, only those beliefs that lead to trading decisions
are the ones that matter. You could call those beliefs that lead to actions the
"true" beliefs of a person. In this sense, there is little room for agnosticism.


### Freedom of belief

The situation becomes more complicated when multiple people are involved.
Since most beliefs are not guaranteed to be true, we can not expect people to
hold the same beliefs. If we force a certain set of beliefs upon other people,
there is a possibility these forced beliefs are wrong; in that case, the forcing
of these beliefs is an injustice. In any case, it is *experienced* as an
injustice by all those who hold other beliefs; the perceived injustice is
damaging even if the forced beliefs are correct. To avoid all this damage and
injustice, it is best to let all people be free to have their own beliefs.
Also, they must be allowed to act upon their own beliefs, at least as far as
their actions only impact themselves. This way, people may harm themselves if
their actions are based on false beliefs; however, harm is not avoided if
certain beliefs are forced on people: the forced beliefs can also be wrong.
At least, in case people act on their own beliefs, they only harm themselves,
and therefore the person who is responsible for selecting a belief is also the
one who is directly rewarded/punished for selecting that belief. This should be
more stimulating towards selecting good beliefs than having some authority force
certain beliefs on other people.

Additional advantages exist to this "freedom of belief" (which includes
"freedom of religion"): a society where people are free to choose their own
beliefs has a wide variety of beliefs; this will make this society more
resilient against the possibility that some of those beliefs are wrong. Even if
the majority of people choose wrong, there will be some people who choose right,
and, if allowed to act upon their alternative beliefs, may be able to save
themselves, and maybe people around them as well. Also, a large group of people
together is more intelligent than even the brightest individual on his own.
Any imposed belief will be worse than the best beliefs that develop when people
are free to believe what they want.
